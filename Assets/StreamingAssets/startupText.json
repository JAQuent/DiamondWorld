At the same time you have to avoid the green icosahedron shapes because you will loose points if you collect them. To gain as many points you have <color=red>five minutes</color>. \nAs explained previously, you move forward by pressing J. You press H & K to turn left/right. Do not forget that you have to end the current action (e.g. moving forward) before you can do something else (e.g. turning left) by pressing the same key again.\nThe experiment and your timer starts as soon as you walk over the blue platform.",
